## 📑 Overview <a id = "Overview"></a>
- Given an image containing a single hand, the system classifies the hand gesture into one of six digits (from 0 to 5).
- The project was done for "Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks" college course to put our understanding of machine learning algorithms into practice with a real world problem.


## 🎉 Our Achievement <a id = "Achievement"></a>
We  have been ranked as the **5th team** on the leader-board out of 20 teams with an accuracy of **66%** on the hidden test set

## How to Run

#### You need to run **_final.py_**. Both **_Preprocess.py_** and **_features_extraction.py_** need to be in the same directory as **_final.py_**.

#### Also needed is to have both _**SVC.sav**_ and _**pca_model.pkl**_ in the same directory as the aforementioned files.

#### The pics need to be in one of the following formats [**_jpg_**, **_jpeg_**, **_png_**, **_bmp_**, **_gif_**] 

#### Create a folder _**data**_ that includes the test images with numerical names **_i.e. 1.png_**
